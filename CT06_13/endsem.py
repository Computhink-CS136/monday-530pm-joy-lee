#Q1
# Print numbers from 10 to 200 using the while loop
# Your numbers must be in multiples of 10.
# 10 must be first number printed, and 200 the last number.

# Example: 10, 20, 30 ..... 180, 190, 200.
# Note that the numbers do not need to be printed in one line.
# Write your code here


# variable1 = 10
# variable2 = 200
# print(variable1)
# for i in range(10,200):
#     step:10
#     print(i)

# Task 2
# Code a password checker to protect your code!

# Assign a password "superpass123" to a variable
# Ask the user to enter a password
# If the password matches, print “Access Granted”
# If the password does not match, print “Access Denied”

# Write your code here

# variable = "superpass123"
# question = "what is the password?"
# answer = input(question)
# if not answer == variable:
#     print("access denied")
# else:
#     print("access granted")



# Basic List Functions
# Do the following operations to the list provided below
# Write the code below each question.

planets = ["mercury","venus", "earth", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus" ]

# 1. Write code below to print the 3rd item 
#    in this list using index e.g. earth
print (planets[2])

# 2. Write code to append neptune to this list.
planets

# 3. Elon Musk has conquered Mars. 
#    Rename Mars in the list to be "muskworld"


# 4. Remove uranus from this list.


# 5. Using a for loop, print all the planets 
#    from this list one by one.
